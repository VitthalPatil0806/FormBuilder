📘 Dynamic Form Layout Builder

A metadata-driven form designer built in React + TypeScript (NX workspace) that allows users to create dynamic forms, configure layout, submit values, generate PDFs, edit previously created forms, and reconfigure form layouts while preserving existing submission data.

🚀 Features Overview
1. Metadata-Driven Form Builder

Create forms using sections → rows → fields.

Drag-free, structured layout with size-based grid system (33%, 50%, 66%, 100%).

Add/remove:

Sections

Rows

Fields (Text, Number, Date, Textarea, Checkbox, Select)

Change field:

Label

Type

Size

Required status

Select options

2. Three View Modes
Mode	Description
Create	User fills the form and submits new record
Edit	Modify previously submitted values
View	Read-only display of submitted data
Layout Edit Mode	Edit form structure only, values remain frozen (used inside builder workflow)
3. Live Preview Modal

Each form can be previewed before saving:

Renders the form using the exact layout

Respects field types, sizes, sections

Prevents editing in layout-edit mode

Supports form submission (create/edit)

4. Form Submission History

Every submitted form instance is saved in local storage:

View submitted values

Edit values

Edit form layout (without destroying values)

Delete individual records

Delete all records

Export individual submission as PDF

5. Advanced PDF Generator

Using jsPDF, the project generates a clean printable PDF:

Preserves the exact layout of the form (row grouping, column widths)

Adds borders and section headers

Shows labels, values, checkboxes, select options

Ideal for printing or storing filled forms

6. Validation System

Validation uses Zod + React Hook Form:

Validates base configuration (form label, view type, section requirements)

Field-level required validation

Layout validation (row size must not exceed 100%)

🛠️ How the System Works (Architecture Overview)
1. Builder Workflow
Sections → Rows → Fields


Each field is defined as metadata:

{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  label: string,
  type: "text" | "number" | "date" | "textarea" | "checkbox" | "select",
  size: "sm" | "md" | "lg" | "xl",
  required: boolean,
  options?: string[]
}

2. Layout Editing Mode

When editing a saved submission’s layout:

Builder loads the previous config

Values are preserved separately

Preview disables field editing

Save updates the layout but not values

🔄 State Management
FormBuilderContext

Stores:

Current working form configuration (label, sections, rows, fields)

Layout-edit mode (editingSubmissionId, editingValues)

Reducer supports operations for adding/removing/updating sections, rows, and fields

FormHistoryContext

Stores submitted forms with:

id
config
values
createdAt
updatedAt


Supports:

addSubmission

updateSubmission

updateSubmissionLayout

deleteSubmission

deleteAllSubmissions

📄 PDF Generation

The PDF is generated by:

pdfGenerator.ts → uses → pdfGeneratorBase.ts


Features:

Exact grid layout (12-column dynamic sizing)

Borders, spacing, cleaned typography

Section headers with decorative icons

Supports all field types

▶ Running the Project
Install dependencies
npm install

Start NX workspace
npx nx serve form-builder


App runs at:

http://localhost:4200

🧪 Testing (If added later)

Recommended:

React Testing Library

🧩 Future Enhancements (Recommended)
High-Value Upgrades

Drag & drop for row/field reordering

Undo/redo system

Field templates (quick add predefined sets)

Conditional logic (show/hide fields dynamically)

Multi-page forms

Backend integration (Mongo/Postgres)

Form versioning system

Enterprise Enhancements

Authentication / multi-user support

Role-based access

Workflow automation

Public form sharing

🏁 Conclusion

This project implements a fully functional, metadata-driven dynamic form builder, complete with:

Layout editing

Value editing

Preview system

PDF export

Submission history

12-column responsive grid

Field validation and configuration

It serves as an excellent foundation for building enterprise-level form management systems, low-code platforms, resume designers, onboarding apps, or workflow tools.
